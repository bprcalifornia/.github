  <p>
    This is the GitHub organization for the Burbank Paranormal Research team, specifically for engineering and IT operations.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have been working on several open-source projects and re-creating the systems that make up the BPR infrastructure from scratch.
  </p>
  <p>
    The hope is that we can help other paranormal investigation teams and organizations with their IT operations by opening up our own IT infrastructure to allow internal code, products, knowledge, and ideas to be shared across disciplines.

    <a href="https://github.com/matthewfritz" title="Matthew Fritz on GitHub">Matthew Fritz</a> (BPR Founder and Director) is a huge proponent of open-source software so the decision to open up our IT infrastructure is a natural one.
  </p>

  <p>
    You will always be able to find the most up-to-date BPR systems in this organization!
